	// types of exception:
	// 1.unchecked exception: compiler can not identified during compilation time.
	// identified during runtime only.all runtime exceptions are unchecked
	// exception.
	// EX:AE.NPE,IO:AIOB,SIOB
	// 2.checked exception: compiler can identify during runtime itself.
	// ex: interrupted exception(Thread.sleep:red line comes),
	// IO:file not found,interruptedIO,EOFE Exception
	// SQL exception

	// try -> we can not write try alone without catch block(it gives error).
    // catch block always associated with try block.
